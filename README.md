# Problem Solving
I grouped the solutions in different maps:
- **Strings**: Solutions to string related problems
- **Numbers**: Solutions to number related problems
- **Recursive**: Recursive solutions
- **Dynamic**: Dynamic solutions

In Main.java there are some problems from *leetcode.com*. I did not include test cases for these problems,
because the website offers testing for the solutions to the problems listed there.
I just used the main function to try some test cases for these problems instead.
